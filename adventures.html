                <h3>STLFurs Furbowling</h3>
                <h4>December 30th, 2017:</h4>
                <p>Fur-bowling, is bowling in Fursuit / With Furries. I went with a local furgroup we went to Brunswick Lanes and went bowling. Had a great time bowling in suit, but accuracy was not that great compared to how I bowl out of suit ^w^. Made a few friends, Mr. Wolf, Skylar Ripa, and even had an oppurtunity to be in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2udHSHv9xwg">Youtube video</a> by a local furry Youtuber named Caffeine Fox!</p>
                <p>This was my first meet with my local communitiy and I really enjoyed it. Sure it was awkward at first, but after I warmed up to everyone I had a great time.</p>
                <p>Now, looking back editing my site, (Mar 2018) going to my first meet in Phoenix was a bit weird of me. And I might have had a bit more fun not doing that. But Phoenix is a wonderful partial and I enjoy wearing him so I respect my decision. <br/>This is also before I finished Phoenix v1.0 so no paws or tail :(</p>

                <h3>STLFurs AMPUP Furmeet</h3>
                <h4>Febuary 3, 2018:</h4>
                <p>Kart-racing, Laser Tag, and Rope Courses. Lots of fun! Sheppy got his drift on and had a great time in the laser tag arena, as well as in the rope courses!</p>
                <p>Funny story actually, we all actually lucked out when there was an incident that made everyone that wasn't in a venue have to leave (not us). <br/> And after a short while, an employee came back and told us that they were going to give everyone 2 free lasertag games on the house! So it was a sweet night! <br/>Met some more friends while I was there; River, Snickrot, and a few others!</p>
                <p>This was my second furmeet with some locals, and again It was a bit awkward at the start but I felt more at home this time and less stressed to go.</p>
                <p>Honestly, as a minor sure it looks and feels awkward to hang out with people much older than you. But, I think of it this way: Everyone there has similar interests; our love for anthropromorphic animals. And hugs of course!</p>
                <p>Didn't feel the need to wear Phoenix to this event, purely because I felt it would get in the way of participating in all the games and activities. + I don't think you could even see while you're kart-racing with a head on.</p>

            <h3>STLFurs Furbowling Spring 2018</h3>
            <h4>April 14, 2018:</h4>
            <p>Bowling! Yay! But this time, on my own!</p>
            <p>Decided to go bowling again, and man did I have a great time! I only got one game in, but I had a blast doing it with my friends.</p>
            <p>Funny story actually, so I was in a lane with all non-suiters. So basically 1v4. Bowled my first set and got a strike! I was really shocked when I made a strike on my first go in suit!</p>
            <p>At the end of the game, I ended up <em><strong>Winning!</em></strong> I was super happy, and had a great time. Met some new people and socialized all night.</p>
            <p>It really felt different this time compared to the first furbowl, I actually knew people and was able to socialize unlike my first meet. I'm really happy with how things have really changed since my first meet.</p>
            <p>I Also made it into another one of Caffeine's videos, describing why foxes are the worst. I actually like foxes, but I do feel guilty for loving how cute they are over sheps haha.</p>

        <p>Bowling! Yay! And with new people!</p>
        <p>Decided to go bowling again, and went with my usual group: River, Blitz, and some others.</p>
        <p>Made a newer friend, Blaze. He's a pretty chill guy. Enjoy hanging out with him. Got 2 rounds in, and enjoyed hanging out with other furries! Lots of suiters this time compared to before!</p>
        <p>Tons, and tons of fursuit photos! Glad I got these, really brings Phoenix to life!</p>
        <p>As for the game, well that really doesn't matter. >.>, <em>I did really bad.</em>

      <h3>Kentucky / Indiana / Holiday World Personal Vay-cay</h3>
      <h4>August 31st-September 1st, 2018:</h4>
      <p>Now this is a true adventure!</p>
      <p>I Decided to embark on a small journey to go visit a friend in Kentucky named IanDragon. I Knew him pretty well from /r/furry, and he invited me down to visit for the weekend!<br/>This was my first flight ever, and man was it something. I Went through the entire experience on my own. And I really felt like an adult for the first time.<br/>I Really enjoyed myself down in Kentucky. Although most of the places we went were more north into Indiana.
        We had alot of fun playing minigolf, laser tag, and at the arcade my second day. And as for my second, I went and visited a local mall that was popular. <br/>On the 3rd day, I went and visited Holiday World up in Christmas, Indiana! And that was an absolute blast!<br/>The Fourth day was my return day, but on my way back, I even got co-pilot!</p>
      <p>Thanks Ian for inviting me up to visit your home town! I Look forward to inviting you down for GFM next year!</p>

                        <h5>March 9th - March 11th, 2018:</h5>
                        <p>Gateway Furmeet was on March 9th through March 11th. I attended from the 9th through the 10th. <br/>And trust me, there is ALOT to cover.</p>
                          <h4>Planning:</h4>
                          <p>Alot of planning went into attending this event: cost, time, how, who, everything. Finishing Phoenix v1.0 was one of my major worries. But overall the biggest struggles were timing and the semi-strict age requirement for independent attendence.</p>
                          <h4>Events / Panels:</h4>
                          <p>I attended a few panels and events while I was there:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Leopardy</li>
                            <li>Whos Lion is it anyway?</li>
                            <li>The Fursuit Parade</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p style="text-muted">In all honesty, reflecting back on my first con; conventions feel more like a chance to socialize than a chance to attend all the panels or go to all the events.<br/> When I first stated planning this whole con out, I wanted to go to a ton of panels, and events; but in the end I only ended up going to 3 or so.<br/> Socializing with friends was just so much fun that I didn't get the chance to attend very many panels!</p>

                        <h4>Outtings / Entertainment:</h4>
                        <p>While at the con, I had a couple meals with some friends. I Live relitively close enough to the con that I really didn't have to worry about purchasing meals or anything. I just ate when I returned home every day. Friday night we ate at the hotel restaurant. And Some friends and I went to Fuzzies saturday night. The parking lot at Wesport Plaza was packed! We had to have spent at least 30 minutes looking for parking before we even got to go in!</p>
                        <p>Latenight, after the panels were finished, the con had a dance from 9-11:55PM and I decided heck why not go. So I went with a friend, and it turns out I really enjoy fursuit dancing. It really makes me happy and gets me going. Seriously, I had 0 idea I liked it till I tried it. And I don't regret one second of dancing on that floor. Without the encouragement of Snickrot, I probably would have never stepped foot on that floor. And when I decided to put my suit on, I kinda just lost all fear and had some good, quality fun!</p>
                        <p>Dancing in suit, made me feel so happy inside like a lightbulb turning on for the first time. I think I'll be doing that more often.</p>

                        <h4>Reflection and Post Con Depression:</h4>
                        <p>Well, heres what I thought of it:<br/> Conventions are fun, no matter the size, or whatever you do. Its how you spend your time, and who you spend it with. I want to thank two very important people I couldn't have attended without. River, you are very close to me now, and now you feel even more like family to me. Without you I probably wouldn't have gone to GFM, or if I did; it would have been very awkward and not as enjoyable.<br/> Now heres a few things I noted in my personal experience as a younger fur:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>You don't have to worry about being young! While I was there, there were alot of younger furs attending! I was really surprised to even see younger furs wearing <em>Full Fursuits!</em></li>
                          <li>Don't worry about looking stupid, you're young, and nobody cares what you do while your young. Make the most of your younger years! You can't be a pup forever!</li>
                          <li>Conventions small or big, are a positive environment! While I was there, I had little to no negitive conversation.</li>
                          <li>Little fur, whatever you do; Don't stray from the pack. You'll instantly regret it. I couldn't last being detached from my brother ott for one minute!</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A Fair warning to those who are planning on attending their first con; let me tell you your first post-con depression hits hard. <em>Really hard.</em> It sucks to go from having so much fun to having to go back to the grind weither it be work, or school. Just think of it this way; you have so many more cons ahead of you to think about inbetween! And who says you can't go to meetups!</p>
                        <p>Overall, my first convention was a blast! I really appreciate those who helped me along my way, and I really hope to be at GFM in 2019! Can't wait to see you all next year!</p>

                      <h4>Midwest Furfest</h4>
                      <h5>November 29th, 2018 - December 1st 2018</h5>
                      <p>Well, there's alot to tell about this one. Let's Simplify it down</p>
                      <p>On the first day we arrived (Thursday night) we played the line-con game, got our badges and checked into our room at the Hyatt. Oh, <em>That's right, we got a room at the Hyatt Regency!</em>.<br/>
                      After we checked in, we met up with our friends Atrius Otter, Admiral Akhlut, Blazi and Chris Hyena.</p>
                      <p>On the first, offical con day we woke up early, and booked our asses to the dealer's den line. <br/> Got in early, got some nice swag and got out. I managed to snag a nice pair of fursuit footpaws, a new bandana, a new tail, and some other goodies. ^w^</p>
                      <p>Friday, I also picked up my service dog / emotional support dog vest. I was so stoked to see it actually in the flesh!<br/>
                      I felt so special when I got it, I mean what a unique idea! And I got all the pets, even outside of suit lol.</p>
                      <p>On the second day, we got up early and had our lovely sponsor brunch. <em>Can I say, the french toast was fantastic. Would recommend trying that next year if you didn't.</em><br/>
                      The rest of the day we spent in the dealer's den, socializing, partying, and suiting.</p>
                      <p>On the third day, Sunday. Things took a turn for the worse. I woke up, constantly coughing, high fever, chills, full body aches, and just overly felt like absolute shit.</br>
                      I soon found out after contacting my physician that I had the flu, and the best part, I couldn't get any help in Chicago because I was a minor and required a parent or legal guardian. And I had neither of those things. <em>My best choice was to head home, as fast as possible.</em></p>
                      <p>My closest friend, River, and all my room mates at MFF helped me in my time of need and I really thank them for that. Without their help, I might have gotten direly sick, stuck in Chicago. But with the combination of their efforts, they got all of my stuff, and River's stuff into our car and got us on our way. Those 5 hours between Chicago and Saint Louis were some of the roughest 5 hours I have ever spent in a car in my life. I was on the verge of passing out the entire time, whilst coughing and feeling like dying. Thankfully, I had the company of River to keep me sane and awake. I Really thank him the most for that. He really helped me the most through my illness. But it came at a great cost to him. He also got the flu shortly after being home from our trip. But, it was worth it. Really shows how much he cares.</p>
                      <p>While my trip was cut short, I still had some of the funnest moments in my life. I got to make so many more friends, and meet so many friends I'd made online, and only known as profile pictures and voices until then. I also got to learn alot about certain parts of the fandom I didn't know much about. Like the pup play community. I knew little to nothing about them, yet after having dinner with two participating members, I learned that they're a wonderful group that just like to wear a different kind of fursuit. I Had alot of fun, I definately got a once in a lifetime opportunity to have some fun for a weekend all by myself. I Worked so hard for it, and I definately earned it. And It was absolutely unforgettable weekend.</p>
