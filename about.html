                <h3>How did I join the fandom?:</h3>
                <p class="lead">In 2017, I got myself into the fandom when I began looking at, and enjoying furry art.</p>
                <p>After a good friend of mine saw my interest in the art he suggested the fandom to me, and I decided to give it a shot.
                <br>Months passed as I slowly grew closer and closer to the fandom. Then I decided to take my largest step, and joined a few online communities of furries; STLFurs, /r/furry, Discord Servers, etc. And It felt really, really good to be apart of something larger than the individual.<br>
                Today, if I was asked if I regret my decision, the answer would be a quick, and assertive no. When I joined those furry communities, I made so many connections, and friendships.<br>
                There is a new adventure every day, and all it takes is engagement in the community! And I'm sure I will be here for the rest of my life. I personally enjoy myself, and have tons of fun every day socializing with other fuzzies ^w^.</p>
                <p>Without the furry fandom, I would absolutely, without a doubt, be a completely different person.</p>

                <h3>Some Information about myself:</H3>
                  <p>I'm a 17 year old highschool student from Saint Louis, Missouri. And I enjoy my classes very much. I'm a tech school / highschool joint operation student where I'm not only
                    learning basic highschool courses, but I'm also learning college-level Cisco networking course material that I can bring over to college, and even to my career after I graduate!</p>

                  <p>Along side my education, I have experience in PC maintenance, diagnosis, and design; virtual-machine operations (EXSi, VMWare etc.); server administration; and web development.</p>

                  <p>I'm a fursuiter, I own a partial, and pictures can be found on my Twitter, Wikifur, and on site.</p>

          <h3 class="display-5">Being a younger fur</h3>
          <p class="lead">The bad, the good, the ugly:</p>
          <p>So, I know you might have a few questions reading through practically my life story and all...<br/> Let me fill in the blanks for you.</p>
          <h6>You have a fursuit!? At 17 years old?!</h6>
          <p>Yes, Yes I do. I got a job, and I worked hard to earn Phoenix. Thats about it, hard work and determination earn you a great reward</p>
          <h6>You own a domain?! At 17 years old?!</h6>
          <p>Ok, I'm seeing a trend here is this an age thing?<br/> Yea, I multiple domain(s) at age 17, I know what I'm doing and I enjoy running a website. Its fun, and a great hobby.</p>
          <h6>So, whats it like being a younger fur? Do you get mistreated, extorted, ostracised?</h6>
          <p>I would describe being a younger furry as having a second childhood, I get to be a kid again but theres also the responsibility of being an adult.<br/> Sure there are nice people, but I've still gotta watch out for the creeps and the psychopaths. And as for "Mistreatment" I don't get any of that, I'd consider myself lucky and fourtinate.</p>
          <h6>Hi, my name is blah blah, and my parents think furries are this, that, and the other:</h6>
          <p>Well, Hello there Blah blah, I see your case alot. I have many friends that suffer the same story you do. You're in constant fear of your parents finding out you stil like anthropromorphic animals, or that your sexuality is not what it seems.<br/> Well honestly theres not much you can do about that. Parents have their own level of judgement and I'm not here to interfere with that. That's for them to decide and for you to observe.<br/> Nobody says you have to be what your parents want you to be. I've had my fair share of "Oh, when you grow up you're gonna have a girl with your wife!" or something like that. <br/><em>Listen. you do you, and don't let anyone stop you.</em> You make the decisions that direct where you go in life. Not the people who you're friends with, or your parents.<br/>Be that dog, or cat you have always imagined in your mind, or that cute little otter that you created when you were 9. Your imagination was built to run free, and you should let it run free.</p>
          <h6>What do your parents think of this?</h6>
          <p>Well, like I said above. My parents aren't going to define who I am, I'm going to define who I am. I'm going to be Phoenix, I'm going to be the dog who makes everything better. <br/>Phoenix is a lean-to, a nullifier, a loveable little pup that makes all my fear go away. He brings me happiness every day, and gives me someone to be when I want to try something else.<br/> Honestly, my parents don't mind me being a furry or being gay. All they care about is my well-being and that I'm what I want to be in life. And I respect that very much.</p>
          <h6>How do you feel attending events with people that are much older than you?</h6>
          <p>Sure, its a bit awkward but I remember that we all have something in common deep down. A love for fuzzy anthropromorphic animals. =) </br>Plus, there are people you can learn to trust and become good friends with. People that are willing to support you, guide you, and protect you. They really matter most, value them.</p>
          <h6>So, how do you keep your friends and classmates from finding out your fuzzy alter-ego?</h6>
          <p>Well, its rather complicated. So let me explain. I keep it simple. Keep my mouth shut about furry related topics. Don't talk about it, don't mention it, and don't even fathom it.<br/> I break a few rules with this concept:<br/><li> I have furry stickers all over my Macbook that I use as a daily driver.</li><br/><li> I occasionally subconciously speak in engwish wike dwis.</li><br/><li> And I occasionally slip and forget to log out of twitter and open it to see fursuit pictures on my timeline in classes. <em>whoops~</em></li></br> Its a game of cat and mouse, hide or be found, rules are simple: <strong>Don't screw up.</strong></p>
